# Cloud Solutions for GodLyd
## General
Backend for the project is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using a compute engine, sql-server, virtual network, and load balancing. 
The compute engine is built on an image created by Packer, based on Google's Container-Optimized OS, enabling easy deployment of docker images. The overall structure of the cloud solution is built using infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform.

**Note:**  
* All files, folders and scripts assume `hlf/cloud` as root, unless otherwise specified.
* When using `cloud.py` for development, end all commands with the `--dev` flag.

## Setup
### Authorization
Follow the steps in the [root README](../README.md), under **Setup** &gt; **Google Cloud Service Account**.

### Downloads
A couple of extra programs and packages are needed to deploy the API.

- **[Packer][packer]**  
  Builds an image of a Virtual Machine based on specifications from `packer.json`.  
  Packer is run with the command `python cloud.py build-packer`, which will (at the end of a long list) output an image ID.

- **[Terraform][terraform]**  
  The Terraform's root folder is `environment/dev/`.  
  Configures the virtual infrastructure needed, including starting a VM from the Packer-built image. (Remember to update the `name` field in `environment/dev/main.tf` to match the latest image ID.)  
  Terraform is run with the command `terraform apply`.

- **[Google Cloud SDK][gcsdk]**  
  Google's tool for connecting to GCP.

### Download secrets

One file is required: `secrets.json`. For instructions on how to download secrets, follow the steps in the [secrets_handler README](../secrets_handler/README.md).

This JSON file contains build information needed for development and production.

**Docker environment variables**  
When building a server image with Packer, an `.env` file must be present. This file will be saved to the image during building, and is used by Docker Compose to set relevant environment variables when starting a server container.

**Docker Compose (yml)**  
The server needs a file called `docker-compose.yml` to be able to start the API container. A template file called `docker-compose.yml.pytemplate` is used as a baseline, and is combined with a few variables from `secrets.json`.

**Nginx (conf)**  
Nginx is used between the load balancer and the API, and is primarily used to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. The configuration file for Nginx needs to be injected with the correct IP and domain, and is generated from `nginx.conf.pytemplate`.

To generate these to files and put them in the `packer_files` folder, run this command:  
`python cloud.py generate-all`

If only one of the files are to be generated, run  
`python cloud.py compose-yml`,  
`python cloud.py conf-nginx` or  
`python cloud.py set-env`  
depending on whether you want the `.conf`, `.env` or `.yml` file.

## Deployment

Docker images used to host the API is preferably stored in the cloud using Google's Container Registry.  
Google's own documentation for this pushing to this register can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling).

1. Download and generate all necessary secrets.
1. Build a Docker image by following the [API guide](../api).
1. Build a Packer image with  
   `python cloud.py build-packer`.
1. Spin up the infrastructure with Terraform.
    - `cd hlf/cloud/environment/<env>`
        - `<env>` is the folder containing environment configuration, e.g. `prod` or `dev`
    - `terraform init`
    - `terraform plan`
    - `terraform apply`
1. Push the latest Docker image to GCP by running  
   `python cloud.py push-docker`.
1. Make the server start the Docker container by running  
   `python cloud.py start-server`.  
    - The API should be up and running (with `/healthcheck` returing 200 OK) after 30-60 seconds.

## Security
### SSL Certificates
[Certbot][certbot] is a tool for automatic creation, verification and renewal of SSL Certificates, through the Certificate Authority _**Letâ€™s Encrypt**_. This first command tells Certbot to create a certificate and private key. An e-mail address is required.

```bash
sudo certbot certonly \
--manual \
--agree-tos \
--manual-public-ip-logging-ok \
--no-eff-email \
--email <your email address> \
--domain dev.api.godlypatruljen.no \
--manual-auth-hook=$CERTBOT_HOOKS/certbot-authenticator.sh \
--manual-cleanup-hook=$CERTBOT_HOOKS/certbot-cleanup.sh
```

This second command creates a Google Cloud Certificate Resource by uploading the certificate and key to our GCP project. This enables us to use the certificate for Google's load balancer service, which all traffic to and from the API must pass through.

```bash
sudo gcloud compute ssl-certificates \
create godlyd-cert \
--certificate=/etc/letsencrypt/live/dev.api.godlypatruljen.no/fullchain.pem \
--private-key=/etc/letsencrypt/live/dev.api.godlypatruljen.no/privkey.pem
```
